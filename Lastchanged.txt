Fixed npm install error by removing non-existent @radix-ui/react-sheet dependency from package.json. Updated UserService to check admin existence via profiles table instead of auth.admin API. Created database triggers for automatic profile creation on user signup. Added paid announcements system with PaidAnnouncementService and database table. Created DataInitializer for complete database setup including categories, wilayas, paid system, and RLS policies. The application now has: ✅ Fixed build dependencies ✅ Admin setup system that checks profiles table ✅ Automatic profile creation triggers ✅ Paid announcements feature ✅ Complete database initialization ✅ All existing functionality preserved. The app should now install and run successfully with npm install && npm run dev.
